# guess-the-movie
UdacityÂ® OOP in Java project: Java based hangman-style guessing-game

## Rules
The program will randomly pick a movie title from a text file that contains a large list of movies. The number of letters in the movie title is indicated by the number of underscores displayed to the user. The user can now start guessing letters. If they guess right the letter and its position is revealed, if they guess wrong they'll lose a point. Every try the user has 10 wrong guesses.
